# Algorithms
  The algorithms are made entirely in objected oriented programming without use of an libraries or external data structures.

## Python
  **Node** (in node.py) is a node representation in a single linked list.  
  **LinkedList** (in linkedlist.py) is a representation of a Linked List Data Structure.  
  **DNode** (in dnode.py) is a node representation in a double linked list.  
  **DoubleLinkedList** (in doublelinkedlist.py) is a representation of a Double Linked List Data Structure.  
  **Stack** (in stack.py) is a representation of a Stack Data Structure.  
  **Queue** (in queue.py) is a representation of a Queue Data Structure.  
  **QIterator** (in queue.py) is a representation of an Iterator of the Queue Data Structure.  
  **HashTable** (in hashtable.py) is a representation of the HashTable Data Structure using simple Hash Function.  
  **Hash Functions** (in hash_functions.py) are simple functions that can be used as hash functions.
