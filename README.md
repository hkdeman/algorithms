## Python
  Node (in node.py) is a node representation in a single linked list.  
  LinkedList (in linkedlist.py) is a representation of a Linked List Data Structure.  
  DNode (in dnode.py) is a node representation in a double linked list.  
  DoubleLinkedList (in doublelinkedlist.py) is a representation of a Double Linked List Data Structure.
